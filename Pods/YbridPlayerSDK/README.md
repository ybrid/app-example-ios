# player-sdk-swift
This audio player is written in Swift 4 and runs on iPhones and iPads from ios 9 to ios 14. 

An example app using this player SDK can be run from the XCode-Project in the repository [app-example-ios](https://github.com/ybrid/app-example-ios).

## Why yet another player?
This audio player offers
- low latency live streaming
- active, user-centric handling of typical network problems
- compatibility: currently supports audio codecs mp3, aac, and opus
- stability


## How to use
Four lines of Swift code to listen to the your radio:
```swift
import YbridPlayerSDK
let url = URL.init(string: "https://stagecast.ybrid.io/adaptive-demo")!
let player = AudioPlayer(mediaUrl: url, listener: nil)
player.play()
// of course the program must not end here
```
As a developer, you probably want to receive changes of the playback state. Implement AudioPlayerListener and pass it to the AudioPlayer via the listener parameter above. You will also receive changes of metadata, hints on problems like network stalls as well as relevant durations and playback buffer size.
```swift
public protocol AudioPlayerListener : class {
    func stateChanged(_ state: PlaybackState)
    func displayTitleChanged(_ title: String?)
    func currentProblem(_ text: String?)
    func playingSince(_ seconds: TimeInterval?)
    func durationReadyToPlay(_ seconds: TimeInterval?)
    func durationConnected(_ seconds: TimeInterval?)
    func bufferSize(averagedSeconds: TimeInterval?, currentSeconds: TimeInterval?)
}
```
The PlaybackStates are 
```swift
public enum PlaybackState {
    case buffering
    case playing
    case stopped
}
```
In case of network stalls, the state will change from playing to buffering at the time of exhausted audio buffer. Try it out! After reconnecting to a network, the player will resume.

## Development environment
We use XCode version 12 with swift 4 and CocoaPods 1.10. According to the nature of evolved XCFrameworks, player-sdk-swift.xcworkspace should be compatible with elder versions of XCode. 

To generate the release artefact 'YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework' we use a shell script written for macOS's terminal, currently version 11.2. Since it basically wrap xcodebuild commands it should be easily translated to other operating systems.

## Integration 
'YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework' uses 'YbridOpus.xcframework' and 'YbridOgg.xcframework'. 

### if you use CocoaPods 
The podspec of the YbridPlayerSDK is currently hosted at [ybrid/Private-Cocoapods](https://github.com/ybrid/Private-Cocoapods). The Cocoa Podfile of a project using this audio player, should look like
```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
install! 'cocoapods', :disable_input_output_paths => true
target 'app-example-ios' do
  use_frameworks!
  source 'git@github.com:ybrid/Private-Cocoapods.git'
  pod 'YbridPlayerSDK'
  target 'app-example-iosUITests' do
  end
end
```
### if you don't use CocoaPods
If you manage packages in another way you may download the neccessary XCFramewoks and embed them into your own project manually. Take the following assets from the latest release
1. YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework.zip from [this repository/releases](https://github.com/ybrid/player-sdk-swift/releases)
2. YbridOgg.xcframework.zip from [ybrid/ogg-swift/releases](https://github.com/ybrid/ogg-swift/releases)  
3. YbridOpus.xcframework.zip from [ybrid/opus-swift/releases](https://github.com/ybrid/opus-swift/releases) 

Usually, you would copy these zips into a directory called 'Frameworks' of your project. In the properties editor, drag and drop them into the section 'Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content' of the target's 'General' tab.
Please report any issue to tell us your need.


## Generating a new release
Choose a new version number, let's say ```0.4.2```. In the following steps you have to type that number three times. 

First generate a new 'YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework'.  
1. Open ```Config.xcconfig``` with an editor of you choice and change the value of ```MARKETING_VERSION``` to the new number an save it.
2. On a terminal, in the project's root directory execute
   ```shell 
   ./build.sh
   ```

Then publish the new YbridPlayerSDK.xcframework' to CocoaPods
1. Ensure the podspec is valid by executing
    ```shell
    ./pod_check.sh
2. Edit the version number in 'YbridPlayerSDK.podspec'. If you work in a branch, be sure to mention it 
    ```ruby
    s.version = '0.4.2'
    ...
    s.source = { :git => 'git@github.com:ybrid/player-sdk-swift', :branch => 'dev', :tag => s.version.to_s }
    ```
3. tag the git repository with the new version number
4. push everything including the tag to origin
5. call 
   ```shell
   ./pod_push.sh
   ```
and stay ready because you have to have to enter your password to the git repositories serveral times.
