/*
 Accumulate data chunks until minBlockBytes is reached.
 Exception: First block is passed as is because it should not slow down start up
 
 It improves the performance for streams with small chunks.
 
 Example:
 cpu usage of mp3 chunks of mostly 1152 bytes (72 ms) is reduces by ~0.5%
 by accumulating to 5184 bytes (324 ms)
 
 Important:
 When supply stops, then reset() needs to be called to use remaining chunks.
